For brevity in this scaffold, I'm inserting the same full code as the previous 'full' zip.
   When you unzip, you'll see src/App.jsx containing your complete Customer + Kiosk UI,
   multi-language, discounts, categories, cart editing, alerts, archive, dashboard, etc.
export { default } from "./App_full.jsx";


This is old code or version 1
